        "I am a Nigeria citizen who was living in Ukraine before the
        invasion, and moved to Switzerland where I'm currently living. I have had a
        few careers in life but learning for me is always fun. I worked as a
        Sales Development Representative, a Project manager and a few more. I
        started my coding my career when I was given the opportunity to learn
        programming  with SheCodes and so far it's been an amazing journey."
        <p>
        "Learning, traveling, and walking are a few of my pastimes after
        receiving a master's degree in Europe. Self-motivation is a flourishing
        tool in my life, with the capacity to have self-discipline and perseverance
        in producing the best version of me."
